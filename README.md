# PinSight  
**Digital Analysis of Pin Profiler Photographs for Soil Surface Roughness**

PinSight is a computer vision–based desktop application for the automated,
accurate, and reproducible processing of mechanical pin profiler photographs,
enabling quantitative characterization of soil surface roughness.

Designed for research in:

- Soil physics  
- Hydrology  
- Erosion science  
- Agricultural engineering  
- Environmental monitoring

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The workflow is structured into three core functional modules:

1. Data Import and Pre-processing  
2. Interactive Pin Editing  
3. Visualization and Reporting  

---

## (a) Annotated Full Interface
![Annotated GUI](./gui_full_visual.png)

**Annotated components:**

1. Board dimension inputs for pixel-to-metric scaling  
2. Optional leveling/detrending toggle  
3. Image import button  
4. Manual profile module  
5. Folder import for batch processing  
6. Export module  
7. Batch statistics panel  
8. Interactive pin editing toggle  
9. Results analysis panel  

---

## (b) Interactive Editing Mode
![Editing Mode](./gui_edit_mode.png)

Manual correction interface allowing users to add, reposition, or delete pins.
All roughness metrics are recalculated instantly.

---

## (c) Visualization Module
![Visualizations](./gui_visualizations.png)

Reconstructed surface profile, autocorrelogram, and log–log semivariogram.

---

## (d) Manual Profile Acquisition Workflow
![Manual Workflow](./gui_manual_profiler.png)

ROI selection and axis calibration for structured manual digitization.
